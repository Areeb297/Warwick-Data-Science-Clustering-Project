### Analyzing voting behaviour and characteristics of different UK constituencies and use clustering techniques to segment regions based on votes

For the clustering diagrams, I used the code by [Ballard (2019)](https://towardsdatascience.com/explaining-the-2019-uk-election-result-with-data-science-86aa6f4e8094) and the function that can use all types of clustering methods and metrics and the rest of the code is the advancement of that project. The code was run in Google Colab to ensure clustering results would be the most reproducible where the results are saved in an excel file published on this repository.
