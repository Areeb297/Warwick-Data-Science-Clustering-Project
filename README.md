# Warwick-Data-Science-Research-Project

The project comprises of analyzing voting behaviour and characteristics of various UK constituencies and exploit clustering techniques to segment regions based on voting and other demographic factors such as population etc, however we exclude the regions feature that each constituency belongs to for our clusters to be unaffected by any geographical factors. This approach can perhaps be more effective when politically targeting constituencies based on clustering algorithms that including regional variables and constituencies having similar geographical locations being grouped into separate clusters. 

For the clustering diagrams, I used the code by [Ballard (2019)](https://www.cb91.io/projects/election) and the function that can use all types of clustering methods and metrics and the rest of the code is the advancement of that project. The code was run in Google Colab to ensure clustering results would be the most reproducible where the results are saved in an excel file published on this repository.
