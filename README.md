# Warwick-Data-Science-Research-Project

The project comprises of analyzing voting behaviour and characteristics of various UK constituencies and exploit clustering techniques to segment regions based on voting and other demographic factors such as population etc, however we exclude the regions feature that each constituency belongs to for our clusters to be unaffected by any geographical factors. This approach can perhaps be more effective when politically targeting constituencies based on clustering algorithms that including regional variables and constituencies having similar geographical locations being grouped into separate clusters. 

For the clustering diagrams, I used some code snippets by [Ballard (2019)](https://github.com/calbal91/project-understanding-elections) in addition to functions created by myself such that all types of clustering methods and metrics can be run with only one main function. This the advancement of that Ballard's project was run on Google Colab to ensure clustering results would be the most reproducible where the results are saved in an excel file published on this repository.
